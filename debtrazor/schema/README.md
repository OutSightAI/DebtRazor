# schema Directory

Welcome to the `schema` directory! This directory contains various Pydantic models and classes that are used for data validation, settings management, and representing different entities and requests within the system. Below is a brief overview of each file/module in this directory to help you get started quickly.

## Files and Modules

### model.py
- **Summary**: Defines a Pydantic model named `Model` with a single attribute `name` of type `str`. This model is used to represent an entity with a name attribute, leveraging Pydantic's data validation and parsing capabilities.
- **Internal Dependencies**: None

### request.py
- **Summary**: Defines two classes, `AgentParams` and `AgentRequest`, using the Pydantic library for data validation and settings management.
  - `AgentParams`: Represents the parameters for an agent, including a model and an optional rerun flag.
  - `AgentRequest`: Encapsulates a request to an agent, detailing various parameters such as document, planner, and migrate agent parameters, entry and output paths, legacy and new programming languages and frameworks, and optional settings for verbose logging and tracing configuration.

### tree.py
- **Summary**: Defines a `DependencyTree` class using Pydantic's `BaseModel` for outputting a dependency tree in JSON format. The class includes two attributes:
  - `dependencies`: An optional list of strings representing file dependencies.
  - `root`: A string representing the root of the dependency tree.
- **Internal Dependencies**: None
