# agents Module

Welcome to the `agents` module! This module is designed to facilitate the creation and management of agents for various tasks, including documentation generation and code processing. Below is an overview of the files and their functionalities within this module:

## Files and Modules

### agent.py
This file defines an abstract base class `Agent` that initializes with a model and tools. The class includes an abstract method `__call__`, which must be implemented by any derived classes. This method is intended to be used for invoking the agent's functionality with arbitrary keyword arguments.

**Internal Dependencies:** None

### __init__.py
This file is currently empty and serves as an initializer for the module. It can be used to include any module-level initializations or imports in the future.

**Internal Dependencies:** None

### doc_agent
The `doc_agent` submodule is designed to facilitate the documentation of code directories and files. It includes various tools and classes to generate detailed documentation, summaries, README.md files, and dependency trees.

#### Files and Modules within `doc_agent`

- **prompts.py**: Defines a set of templates and prompt configurations for generating detailed documentation, summaries, README.md files, and dependency trees for code files. It uses the `ChatPromptTemplate` class from the `langchain_core.prompts.chat` module to create instances of these templates.

  **Internal Dependencies:** None

- **agent.py**: Defines the `DocAgent` class, a specialized agent for processing and documenting code directories and files. The `DocAgent` class extends from a base `Agent` class and utilizes various tools and models to generate documentation, summaries, and dependency trees for code files.

  **Internal Dependencies:** 
  - prompts.py
  - ../../tools/utils.py
  - ../../utils/util.py
  - ../agent.py
  - ../../utils/logging.py
  - state.py

- **__init__.py**: This file is currently empty and serves as an initializer for the submodule. It can be used to include any submodule-level initializations or imports in the future.

  **Internal Dependencies:** None

- **state.py**: Defines the `DocAgentState` class, which extends `AgentState` to manage the state of a documentation agent. This class includes attributes to help in tracking the documentation process, including paths, files, directories, dependencies, and formatting details.

  **Internal Dependencies:** 
  - ../state.py

### state.py
This file defines a `TypedDict` class named `AgentState` that represents the state of an agent. This class includes a single attribute, `messages`, which is a list of `AnyMessage` objects. The `Annotated` type is used with `operator.add` for potential type checking or validation purposes.

**Internal Dependencies:** None

## Getting Started

To get started with the `agents` module, you can initialize the `Agent` class or any of its derived classes and use their methods to perform various tasks. For documentation purposes, you can use the `DocAgent` class from the `doc_agent` submodule to process and document your code directories and files. Make sure to configure the necessary models and tools as per your requirements.
