# tree Module

The `tree` module is designed to generate internal dependency trees for both Python and Node.js projects. This module contains tools that analyze the dependencies of a given project and represent them in a structured format. Below is a brief overview of the files included in this module:

## Files

### `__init__.py`
This file is currently empty and serves as an initializer for the `tree` module. It allows the directory to be recognized as a Python package.

### `python.py`
This file defines a tool named `pydeps` for generating an internal dependency tree for Python projects. The main function takes a file path as input and returns a `DependencyTree` object representing the root file and its dependencies. Key points include:
- Utilizes the `PyModule` and `ModuleSet` classes from the `import_deps` package.
- Returns an error message if the `import_deps` package is not found.
- Internal Dependencies: `../../schema/tree.py`

### `node_js.py`
This file defines a tool named `madge` for generating an internal dependency tree for Node.js projects. The main function takes a file path as input and returns a `DependencyTree` object representing the project's root and its dependencies. Key points include:
- Uses the `subprocess` module to run the `madge` command and capture its JSON output.
- Returns an error message if the `madge` tool is not installed or if an error occurs during execution.
- Internal Dependencies: `../../schema/tree.py`

## Getting Started

To get started with the `tree` module, ensure that you have the necessary dependencies installed for both Python and Node.js projects. For Python, you will need the `import_deps` package, and for Node.js, you will need the `madge` tool.

### Installation

For Python dependencies:
```bash
pip install import_deps
```

For Node.js dependencies:
```bash
npm install -g madge
```

### Usage

#### Python Dependency Tree
To generate a dependency tree for a Python project:
```python
from tree.python import generate_dependency_tree

dependency_tree = generate_dependency_tree('path/to/your/python/file.py')
print(dependency_tree)
```

#### Node.js Dependency Tree
To generate a dependency tree for a Node.js project:
```python
from tree.node_js import generate_dependency_tree

dependency_tree = generate_dependency_tree('path/to/your/nodejs/project')
print(dependency_tree)
```

## Conclusion

The `tree` module provides a straightforward way to analyze and visualize the dependencies of your Python and Node.js projects. By following the instructions above, you can quickly get started and integrate these tools into your development workflow.
