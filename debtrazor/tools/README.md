# tools

Welcome to the `tools` module! This directory contains various utilities and tools designed to assist in the development and maintenance of your projects. Below is an overview of the files and modules included in this directory, along with their respective functionalities.

## Files and Modules

### 1. `__init__.py`
**Summary:** This file is currently empty and serves as an initializer for the `tools` module. It allows the directory to be recognized as a Python package.

### 2. `utils.py`
**Summary:** This file defines a function `execute_tool` that processes a message containing tool calls and executes the corresponding tool from a given list of tools. The function takes two parameters:
- `message`: Expected to have a `tool_calls` attribute containing a list of dictionaries with tool names and arguments.
- `tools`: A list of tool objects, each having a `name` and a callable `func` attribute.

The function returns the result of the tool's function if a matching tool is found and executed; otherwise, it returns `None`.

### 3. `tree`
**Summary:** The `tree` module is designed to generate internal dependency trees for both Python and Node.js projects. This module contains tools that analyze the dependencies of a given project and represent them in a structured format.

#### Files in `tree` Module:
- `__init__.py`: Empty initializer file for the `tree` module.
- `python.py`: Defines a tool named `pydeps` for generating an internal dependency tree for Python projects.
- `node_js.py`: Defines a tool named `madge` for generating an internal dependency tree for Node.js projects.

### 4. `dependency_tree`
**Summary:** The `dependency_tree` module is designed to manage and visualize the dependencies within a project. This module helps in understanding the relationships between various components, making it easier to maintain and develop new features.

#### Files in `dependency_tree` Module:
- `parser.py`: Contains functions to parse dependency files and extract relevant information.
- `visualizer.py`: Provides functionalities to create visual representations of the dependency tree.
- `analyzer.py`: Includes functions to analyze the dependency tree, identify circular dependencies, unused dependencies, and provide optimization suggestions.
- `config.py`: Handles the configuration settings for the dependency tree.
- `utils.py`: Contains utility functions used across the `dependency_tree` module.
- `README.md`: Provides an overview of the `dependency_tree` module, explaining its purpose and summarizing the contents of each file and module.
