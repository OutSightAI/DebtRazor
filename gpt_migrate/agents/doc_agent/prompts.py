 Current Task: Given a code file as an input in {language} {framework}, you
 need add detailed doc comment for each method in the code file. The doc
 comment should describe what the method does. The doc comment should also
 include the input and output parameters alongside small description of each
 parameter. You should also add inline comments to the code where it make sense
 to make it more readable and easier to understand. \n\n
 Expected Output: The complete code file with detailed doc and inline comments.
 You must return the complete code file as the file answer and not just the
 comments. Do not add any extra verbosity to the code file. This will break the
 downstream application if you do not follow the instruction properly. \n\n"""
